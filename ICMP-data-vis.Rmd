## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for statistics derived from specimen data of the ICMP culture collection <https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/icmp>. This is an experimental showcase of presenting visulisations of data analysed in R in a user-friendly format.

```{r import, include=FALSE}

#import the files
ICMP.dump.initial <- read.csv("ICMP-export-21-oct-2021.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#subset the data
#tidyverse way of sub setting - remove viruses and deaccessioned cultures
ICMP.dump <- ICMP.dump.initial %>%
  filter(SpecimenType == "Bacterial Culture" | 
           SpecimenType == "Chromist Culture" | 
           SpecimenType == "Fungal Culture" | 
           SpecimenType == "Yeast Culture") %>%
  filter(Deaccessioned == "false")

#how many cultures are public
ICMP.public <- ICMP.dump.initial %>%
  filter(SpecimenSecurityLevelText == "Public")

```

## General statistics

The ICMP database has `r count(ICMP.dump.initial)` entries, removing cultures that have died and are no longer available ('deaccessioned') there are **`r count(ICMP.dump)` cultures**. This total includes cultures stored privately not available to the public, and those in the process of storage. The total of publicly available cultures is `r count(ICMP.public)`. Most of the stats below use the number in bold.

(also should include NZ only stats)

```{r tables, echo=FALSE}


#ktable.specimen2 <- count(ICMP.dump,SpecimenType) #dpylr
#kable(ktable.specimen2, caption = "Basic stats") #knitr

#table of specimen types
table.stypes <- ICMP.dump %>% 
  group_by(SpecimenType) %>%
  tally()
kable(table.stypes, caption = "table of specimen types") #knitr


```

## Type cultures

The ICMP has a number of type cultures.

```{r types, echo=TRUE}

ICMP.types <- subset(ICMP.dump,!(TypeStatus == ""))
table(ICMP.types$SpecimenType)

```

There are different 'kinds' of types. Bacterial types are 'type strains', bacterial pathovars are 'pathotype strains'. Fungal type cultures may have been isolated from a type specimen (e.g. from PDD) and are thus 'ex types'.

```{r types chart, echo=FALSE}

#barchart of all ICMP types sorted by 'kind' of type, coloured by kind of organism
positions <- c("Type strain", "Pathotype strain", "Neopathotype strain", "Type", "ex Type",  "Holotype", "ex Holotype", "Paratype", "ex Paratype", "Isotype", "Neotype", "ex Neotype", "Epitype", "ex Epitype", "Syntype", "Reference strain")
ggplot(ICMP.types, aes(TypeStatus, fill=SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Types in the ICMP culture collection") +
  labs(x = "'Kind' of type", y = "number of cultures") +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.75)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions)

```

## Extended specimen data

Extended specimen data is data beyond the basic taxonomic and and location. See: <https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/1/23/5637849> The charts below show the proportion of ICMP cultures that have DNA sequences lodged in GenBank global repository, images (usually of culture plates), and when a culture is specifically cited in literature.

```{r Extended specimen data, echo=FALSE}

#sub set out the interesting columns using "select" in dpylr
library(dplyr)
only.ext.specimen <- select(ICMP.dump, "AccessionNumber","SpecimenType", "GenBank", "Literature", "Images")

#create two new columns using "pivot_longer" into a tibble table
library(tidyr)
tibble.ext.specimen <-pivot_longer(only.ext.specimen, cols=3:5, names_to="ExtendedSpecimen", values_to="present")

# ** Cultures with extended specimen data
ggplot(tibble.ext.specimen, aes(ExtendedSpecimen, fill=present)) +
  labs(title = "Cultures with GenBank DNA sequences, images, and citations in literature") +
  labs(x = "extended specimen data", y = "proportion of cultures with this data") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

```

This data can be split by the type of specimen (Bacteria, Fungi, Chromist, Yeast) to show the relative proportions of extended specimen data for each of these.

```{r Extended specimen data 2, echo=FALSE}

# ** Cultures with extended specimen data by ExtendedSpecimen with SpecimenType facet
ggplot(tibble.ext.specimen, aes(ExtendedSpecimen, fill=present)) +
  labs(title = "Cultures with GenBank DNA sequences, images, and citations in literature") +
  labs(x = "Taxon", y = "number of isolates") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.92, 0.6)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(SpecimenType))

```

## Geography

ICMP cultures have been isolated from around the world.

### world map

```{r world map, echo=FALSE}

world <- map_data("world")
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = world, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "grey") +
  theme_void() +
  geom_point(data = ICMP.dump, aes(x = DecimalLong, y = DecimalLat), color = "red", size = 1, alpha = 0.2) +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
  
```

The top 10 countries represented in the ICMP with type of samples are shown below.

```{r top countries, echo=FALSE}

positions <- c("New Zealand", "United States", "Australia", "United Kingdom", "Brazil", "Japan", "Thailand", "China", "India",  "Italy")

ICMP.10county <- subset(ICMP.dump, (Country == "New Zealand" | Country == "United States" | Country == "Australia" | Country == "United Kingdom" | Country == "Brazil" | Country == "Thailand" | Country == "China" | Country == "Japan" | Country == "India" | Country == "Italy"))

ggplot(ICMP.10county, aes(Country, fill=SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Countries in the ICMP") +
  labs(x = "Country", y = "number of cultures") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-90, hjust=0)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.75)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions)
  
```

### New Zealand map

Each of the cultures from New Zealand that have a geocoordinate are plotted below.

```{r nz map, echo=FALSE}

ICMP.NZ <- subset(ICMP.dump,(Country == "New Zealand"))

ICMP.no.chat <- ICMP.NZ %>%
  filter(NZAreaCode != "Chatham Islands") %>%
  filter(NZAreaCode != "Kermadec Islands")

nz <- map_data("nzHires")
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = nz, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "grey") +
  theme_void() +
  geom_point(data = ICMP.no.chat, aes(x = DecimalLong, y = DecimalLat), color = "red", size = 1, alpha = 0.2) +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
  
```

There are various ways to divide Aotearoa New Zealand in regions. The ICMP uses 'Crosby Codes' which were developed for for recording specimen localities in the New Zealand. The ICMP is based in Auckland explaining the large number of collections from this region.

```{r top NZ area codes, echo=FALSE}

#New Zealand Area codes
ICMP.NZ <- subset(ICMP.dump,(Country == "New Zealand"))

positions <- c("New Zealand", "Campbell Island", "Auckland Islands", "Snares Islands", "Chatham Islands",  "Stewart Island", "Southland", "Fiordland", "Dunedin", "Central Otago", "Otago Lakes", "South Canterbury", "Mackenzie", "Westland", "Mid Canterbury", "North Canterbury", "Buller", "Kaikoura", "Marlborough", "Nelson", "Marlborough Sounds", "South Island", "Wairarapa", "Wellington", "Hawkes Bay", "Rangitikei", "Wanganui", "Gisborne", "Taupo", "Taranaki", "Bay of Plenty", "Waikato", "Coromandel", "Auckland", "Northland", "North Island", "Three Kings Islands", "Kermadec Islands")

ggplot(ICMP.NZ, aes(NZAreaCode)) +
  labs(title = "ICMP cultures by NZ region") +
  labs(x = "Crosby Region", y = "number of cultures") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-90, hjust=0)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions)

```

## Timeline

```{r all isolated dates chart, echo=FALSE}

#standard all ICMP overtime stats faceted

date.isolated <-ymd(ICMP.dump$IsolationDateISO, truncated = 1)
ggplot(ICMP.dump, aes(date.isolated, fill = SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Isolation dates of ICMP cultures") +
  labs(x = "Date of isolation", y =  "Number of cultures" , fill = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=365.25, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(SpecimenType ~ .)

```

### Isolation month

In the New Zealand autum, May is the peak mushroom fruiting season explaing the Jan may be an artifact of missing month or more likely the old way of entering data. Can I remove these??

less in winter, more in summer trend.

```{r NZ isolated month chart, echo=FALSE}

#new month ICMP culture isolated (in NZ)
attach(ICMP.NZ) 
month.isolated <- ymd(ICMP.NZ$IsolationDateISO, truncated = 1)
mergemonths <- floor_date(month.isolated, unit = "month")
ggplot(ICMP.NZ, aes(month(mergemonths, label = TRUE), fill = SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Isolation month of ICMP cultures from NZ") + 
  labs(x = "Month of isolation", y =  "Number of cultures" , fill = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_x_discrete(na.translate = FALSE)  # this removes NAs

```

## Curation stats

These stats may be useful for curation or data checking for ICMP staff.

### Last updated user

```{r last updated user chart, echo=FALSE}

#pie chart by last updated user
ICMP.dump$LastUpdatedBy <- sapply(ICMP.dump$UpdatedBy, tolower)
ggplot(ICMP.dump, aes(x=factor(1), fill=LastUpdatedBy)) +
  labs(title = "Last user to update an ICMP record") +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")

```

```{r table of security levels , echo=FALSE}

#table of security levels
table.security <- ICMP.dump %>% 
  group_by(SpecimenSecurityLevelText) %>%
  tally()
kable(table.security, caption = "table of security levels") #knitr

```

```{r table of biostatus , echo=FALSE}

#table of security levels
table.security <- ICMP.dump %>% 
  group_by(OccurrenceDescription) %>%
  tally()
kable(table.security, caption = "table of biostatus Occurrence") #knitr

#table of security levels
table.security <- ICMP.dump %>% 
  group_by(BiostatusDescription) %>%
  tally()
kable(table.security, caption = "table of biostatus description") #knitr

```

This table shows the first few rows of the full dataset. use the arrows to explore across the columns.

```{r testing, echo=FALSE}

rmarkdown::paged_table(head(ICMP.dump))

```
