## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for statistics derived from specimen data of the ICMP culture collection <https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/icmp>. This is an experimental showcase of presenting visualisations of data analysed in R in a user-friendly format. The ICMP is the national culture collection of Aotearoa New Zealand with a focus on plant-associated microbes and fungi including 'mushrooms'.

```{r import, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#import the files
ICMP.as.imported.df <- read_csv("ICMP-export-2-dec-2021.csv",
                                guess_max = Inf,
                                show_col_types = FALSE
                                )
#subset the data
#tidyverse way of sub setting - remove viruses and deaccessioned cultures
ICMP.df <- ICMP.as.imported.df %>%
  distinct(AccessionNumber, .keep_all= TRUE) %>% #remove dupes
  filter(SpecimenType == "Bacterial Culture" | 
           SpecimenType == "Chromist Culture" | 
           SpecimenType == "Fungal Culture" | 
           SpecimenType == "Yeast Culture") %>%
  filter(Deaccessioned == "FALSE")

#how many cultures are public
ICMP.public <- ICMP.initial.df %>%
  filter(SpecimenSecurityLevelText == "Public")

```

## General statistics

The ICMP database has `r count(ICMP.initial.df)` entries, but after removing cultures that have died and are no longer available ('deaccessioned') there are **`r count(ICMP.df)` cultures**. This total includes cultures stored privately not available to the public, and those in the process of storage. The total number of publicly available cultures is `r count(ICMP.public)`. Most of the stats below use the 'total minus deaccessioned' number as the base data.

The table below lists the number of bacterial, chromist (e.g. *Phytophthora*), fungal, and yeast cultures in the collection; stats include the entire collection and split by type cultures and New Zealand cultures.

```{r tables, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

total.table <- ICMP.df %>% # this one gets a total count
  group_by(SpecimenType) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    All.ICMP = n(), 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

types.table <- ICMP.df %>% # this one gets a types count
  filter(TypeStatus != "") %>%
  group_by(SpecimenType) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    Types = n(), 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

NZ.table <- ICMP.df %>% # this one gets a New Zealand count
  filter(Country == "New Zealand") %>%
  group_by(SpecimenType) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    NZ = n(), 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

NZtype.table <- ICMP.df %>% # NZ and types
  filter(Country == "New Zealand" & TypeStatus != "") %>%
  group_by(SpecimenType) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    NZ.Types = n(), 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

icmp.count.table <- left_join(total.table, types.table) %>%
  left_join(NZ.table) %>%
  left_join(NZtype.table) %>%
  bind_rows(summarise(.,
                      across(where(is.numeric), sum),
                      across(where(is.character), ~"Total")))

kable(icmp.count.table, digits=0, "html",
      #caption = "table of specimen types",
      col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(icmp.count.table)))%>% #replaces dots in names with spaces
  kable_styling("striped", "bordered") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,  "number of cultures" = 4))

```

## Type cultures

```{r types, echo=TRUE}

ICMP.types <- subset(ICMP.df,!(TypeStatus == ""))

```

The ICMP has **`r count(ICMP.types)` type cultures** cultures. There are different 'kinds' of types. Bacterial types are 'type strains', bacterial pathovars are 'pathotype strains'. Fungal type cultures may have been isolated from (*ex*) a type specimen (e.g. from PDD) and are thus 'ex types'.

```{r types chart, echo=TRUE}

#barchart of all ICMP types sorted by 'kind' of type, coloured by kind of organism
positions <- c("Type strain", "Pathotype strain", "Neopathotype strain", "Type", "ex Type",  "Holotype", "ex Holotype", "Paratype", "ex Paratype", "Isotype", "Neotype", "ex Neotype", "Epitype", "ex Epitype", "Syntype", "Reference strain")
ggplot(ICMP.types, aes(TypeStatus, fill=SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Types in the ICMP culture collection") +
  labs(x = "'Kind' of type", y = "number of cultures") +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.75)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions)

```

## Extended specimen data

Extended specimen data is data beyond the basic taxonomic and and location. See: <https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/70/1/23/5637849> The charts below show the proportion of ICMP cultures that have DNA sequences lodged in GenBank global repository, images (usually of culture plates), and when a culture is specifically cited in literature.

```{r Extended specimen data, echo=TRUE}

#sub set out the interesting columns using "select" in dpylr
only.ext.specimen <- select(ICMP.df, "AccessionNumber","SpecimenType", "GenBank", "Literature", "Images")

#create two new columns using "pivot_longer" into a tibble table
tibble.ext.specimen <-pivot_longer(only.ext.specimen, cols=3:5, names_to="ExtendedSpecimen", values_to="present")

# ** Cultures with extended specimen data
ggplot(tibble.ext.specimen, aes(ExtendedSpecimen, fill=present)) +
  labs(title = "Cultures with GenBank DNA sequences, images, and citations in literature") +
  labs(x = "extended specimen data", y = "proportion of cultures with this data") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

```

This data can be split by the type of specimen (Bacteria, Fungi, Chromist, Yeast) to show the relative proportions of extended specimen data for each of these.

```{r Extended specimen data 2, echo=TRUE}

# ** Cultures with extended specimen data by ExtendedSpecimen with SpecimenType facet
ggplot(tibble.ext.specimen, aes(ExtendedSpecimen, fill=present)) +
  labs(title = "Cultures with GenBank DNA sequences, images, and citations in literature") +
  labs(x = "Taxon", y = "number of isolates") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.92, 0.6)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(SpecimenType))

```

## Host plants

Many ICMP cultures are associated with a host plant, for example rhizobia in legume nodules, or plant pathogenic fungi causing leaf spots. Below are the top 10 most common host plant families in the ICMP with type of organism. The large number of legume hosts likely relates to the large number of symbiotic rhizobia in the collection.

```{r top 10 host families, echo=TRUE}

#barchart of to 10 host families sorted by 'kind' of type, coloured by kind of organism
positions.10hosts <- c("Leguminosae", "Solanaceae", "Rosaceae", "Gramineae", "Actinidiaceae", "Myrtaceae", "Vitaceae", "Compositae", "Nothofagaceae",  "Cucurbitaceae")
ICMP.10hosts <- subset(ICMP.df, (Family_C2 == "Leguminosae" | Family_C2 == "Solanaceae" | Family_C2 == "Rosaceae" | Family_C2 == "Gramineae" | Family_C2 == "Actinidiaceae" | Family_C2 == "Myrtaceae" | Family_C2 == "Vitaceae" | Family_C2 == "Compositae" | Family_C2 == "Nothofagaceae" | Family_C2 == "Cucurbitaceae"))

ggplot(ICMP.10hosts, aes(Family_C2, fill=SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 host plant Families in the ICMP culture collection") +
  labs(x = "Host plant Family", y = "number of cultures") +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.75)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions.10hosts)

```

## Geography

ICMP cultures have been isolated from around the world.

### World distribution

```{r world map, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

world <- map_data("world")
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = world, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "grey") +
  theme_void() +
  geom_point(data = ICMP.df, aes(x = DecimalLong, y = DecimalLat), color = "red", size = 1, alpha = 0.2) +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
  
```

The top 10 countries represented in the ICMP with type of samples are shown below.

```{r top countries, echo=TRUE}

positions <- c("New Zealand", "United States", "Australia", "United Kingdom", "Brazil", "Japan", "Thailand", "China", "India",  "Italy")

ICMP.10county <- subset(ICMP.df, (Country == "New Zealand" | Country == "United States" | Country == "Australia" | Country == "United Kingdom" | Country == "Brazil" | Country == "Thailand" | Country == "China" | Country == "Japan" | Country == "India" | Country == "Italy"))

ggplot(ICMP.10county, aes(Country, fill=SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Countries in the ICMP") +
  labs(x = "Country", y = "number of cultures") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-90, hjust=0)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.75)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions)
  
```

### New Zealand distribution

Each of the cultures from New Zealand that have a geocoordinate are plotted below. An interactive map can be found on GBIF at: <https://www.gbif.org/dataset/3c6e7390-3b56-11dc-8c19-b8a03c50a862>.

```{r nz map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#ICMP.NZ <- subset(ICMP.df,(Country == "New Zealand"))

#ICMP.no.chat <- ICMP.NZ %>%
#  filter(NZAreaCode != "Chatham Islands") %>%
#  filter(NZAreaCode != "Kermadec Islands")

#nz <- map_data("nzHires")
#ggplot() + 
#  geom_polygon(data = nz, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "grey") +
#  theme_void() +
#  geom_point(data = ICMP.no.chat, aes(x = DecimalLong, y = DecimalLat, colour = NZAreaCode), size = #1, alpha = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
#  coord_fixed(1.3)

# Loading in data 
#Reading in a NZ specific map
nz.sf <- st_read(dsn = "./data/coastline/coastline.shp", quiet = TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(2193) #Setting map projection - NZGD2000

#Transforming to an SF object
rhizoNZ.sf <- ICMP.df %>%
  filter(!is.na(DecimalLat)) %>% #Removing missing obs as sf doesn't play with these
  st_as_sf(coords = c("DecimalLong", "DecimalLat")) %>% #Defining what the coord columns are
  st_set_crs(4326) %>% #Telling sf it is in WSG84 projection
  st_transform(2193) %>% #Changing it to NZGD2000 to match coastline polygon
  st_crop(st_bbox(nz.sf)) #Cropping out points that are outside the coastline polygons bounding box (e.g. not NZ)

#Plotting - quite slow
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nz.sf) +
  geom_sf(data = rhizoNZ.sf, aes(colour = NZAreaCode),
          size = 1, alpha = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  annotation_scale(location = "br") +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tl",
                         which_north = "true",
                         style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering) +
  theme_minimal()
  
```

There are various ways to divide Aotearoa New Zealand in regions. The ICMP uses 'Crosby Codes' which were developed for for recording specimen localities in the New Zealand. The ICMP is based in Auckland explaining the large number of collections from this region.

```{r top NZ area codes, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

#New Zealand Area codes
ICMP.NZ <- subset(ICMP.df,(Country == "New Zealand"))

positions <- c("New Zealand", "Campbell Island", "Auckland Islands", "Snares Islands", "Chatham Islands",  "Stewart Island", "Southland", "Fiordland", "Dunedin", "Central Otago", "Otago Lakes", "South Canterbury", "Mackenzie", "Westland", "Mid Canterbury", "North Canterbury", "Buller", "Kaikoura", "Marlborough", "Nelson", "Marlborough Sounds", "South Island", "Wairarapa", "Wellington", "Hawkes Bay", "Rangitikei", "Wanganui", "Gisborne", "Taupo", "Taranaki", "Bay of Plenty", "Waikato", "Coromandel", "Auckland", "Northland", "North Island", "Three Kings Islands", "Kermadec Islands")

ggplot(ICMP.NZ, aes(NZAreaCode)) +
  labs(title = "ICMP cultures by NZ region") +
  labs(x = "Crosby Region", y = "number of cultures") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-90, hjust=0)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = positions)

```

## Timeline

```{r calulate earliest culture dates, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}

#this is just for data checking e.g. ranking the early ones don't display in the final version

#all cultures sorted by date. Add a new column date.isolated 
ICMP.df$date.isolated <- ymd(ICMP.df$IsolationDateISO, truncated = 3)
arrange(ICMP.df, date.isolated) %>%
  select("AccessionNumber","SpecimenType", "Country", "date.isolated") %>%
  slice_head(n=5)

#all cultures sorted by deposited date. Add a new column date.isolated

### Isolations and deposits over time

```{r all isolated dates chart, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

#standard all ICMP overtime stats faceted

date.isolated <-ymd(ICMP.df$IsolationDateISO, truncated = 3)
ggplot(ICMP.df, aes(date.isolated, fill = SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Isolation dates of ICMP cultures") +
  labs(x = "Date of isolation", y =  "Number of cultures" , fill = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "10 years", date_labels = "%Y") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=365.25, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(SpecimenType ~ ., scales = "fixed")

```

```{r all deposited dates chart, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

#ICMP deposit date faceted
date.deposited <-ymd(ICMP.df$DepositedDateISO, truncated = 3)
ggplot(ICMP.df, aes(date.deposited, fill = SpecimenType)) +

```

```{r bacteria deposits chart, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ICMP.bacteria <- subset(ICMP.df,(SpecimenType == "Bacterial Culture"))

ICMP.bacteria$date.deposited <- ymd(ICMP.bacteria$DepositedDateISO, truncated = 3)
ggplot(ICMP.bacteria, aes(date.deposited)) +

  labs(title = "Date bacterial cultures were deposited in ICMP") +
  labs(x = "Date of deposit", y =  "Number of cultures" , fill = "") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "10 years", date_labels = "%Y") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=365.25, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_density(aes(y=500 * ..count..), size = 2) #multiplies the density by 500x so it is visible

```

### Isolation month

In the New Zealand autumn, May is the peak mushroom fruiting season explain the number of fungi isolated in this month. In general there is a trend of fewer isolations in Winter and more in Summer. The high numbers in January may be an artifact of a prior way recording the data in the database which if the month was unknown it would be recorded as January.

less in winter, more in summer trend.

```{r NZ isolated month chart, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#new month ICMP culture isolated (in NZ)
attach(ICMP.NZ) 
month.isolated <- ymd(ICMP.NZ$IsolationDateISO, truncated = 1)
mergemonths <- floor_date(month.isolated, unit = "month")
ggplot(ICMP.NZ, aes(month(mergemonths, label = TRUE), fill = SpecimenType)) +
  labs(title = "Isolation month of ICMP cultures from NZ") + 
  labs(x = "Month of isolation", y =  "Number of cultures" , fill = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_x_discrete(na.translate = FALSE)  # this removes NAs

```

## People

Top 10 collectors, isolators, identifiers. This will be better once we get the agents module working, which will reduce the duplicates. Will convert to charts at that time.

```{r top collectors etc.}

#should combine these to a single table using full_join ?

#topCollector <- ICMP.df %>% 
#  count(StandardCollector, sort = TRUE) %>%
#  drop_na() %>%
#  slice_head(n=10)
#
#kable(topCollector, digits=0, "html",
#      caption = "top collectors") %>%
#  kable_styling("striped", "bordered")

#this works but is a bit shit till the agents modules matches names correctly
topCollector <- ICMP.df %>% 
  count(StandardCollector, sort = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice_head(n=10)

topDeterminer <- ICMP.df %>% 
  count(StandardDeterminer, sort = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice_head(n=10)

topDepositor <- ICMP.df %>% 
  count(DepositorName, sort = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice_head(n=10)

people.table <- full_join(topCollector, topDeterminer, 
                          by = c("StandardCollector" = "StandardDeterminer" )) %>%
  full_join(topDepositor,
            by = c("StandardCollector" = "DepositorName" ))

people.table

kable(people.table, digits=0, #"html",
      #caption = "table of specimen types",
      col.names = c('Person name', 'Collected', 'Determined', 'Deposited')
)%>% #replaces dots in names with spaces
  kable_styling("striped", "bordered") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,  "number of events" = 3))

```

## Curation stats
