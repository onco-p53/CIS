## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for statistics derived from specimen data of the ICMP culture collection. This is an experimental showcase of presenting visulisations of data analysed in R in a user-freindly format. 

```{r}
ICMP.dump.initial <- read.csv("ICMP-export-27-jun-2021.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```



## General stats

Here include the number of specimens, types ect. as a table.

```{r}
ICMP.dump.initial <- read.csv("ICMP-export-27-jun-2021.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
